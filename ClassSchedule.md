#  Day 1 

Today will practice refactoring with small steps without understanding the code first.

## Introductions [ 1 hour]
* Lines (Rate yourself
  * Height
  * Name
  * Distance
  * Programmer
  * Unit testing 
  * Refactoring
  * What’s code like at work

# DAY 2

Today we will finish up chartsmart and look at 
look at testing.

## ChartSmart (Mob)

* Finish Duplication and Extract Objects
* Lift Conditional 

## Testing Functional Code Kata  (Paired)
   [If code is functional it is very easy to test]
 
## Emily Bache Gilded Rose (Mob & Paired)
* Combination Testing (Start in a mob, get to 4 * combinations, then split up)
* 100% Code coverage
* Lift Conditional
* Seperate into classes
* Retro
* Clean Up.



Following sessions:
Mutation Testing
The Russian Connection
Peel and Slice




Notes: 
Working in “our” manner allows us to work without understanding the code.

Llewellyn mentioned this about a sessions at AONW
“I hate that, but I want to do it so I can hate it with data”
